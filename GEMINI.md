## Directory Overview

This directory contains the planning and architectural documentation for **CartaOS**, a software project currently in the design phase. The project is envisioned as an integrated research ecosystem designed to automate and enhance the workflow of academic researchers.

The directory is structured as a collection of Markdown files that together define the project's vision, architecture, technology stack, and initial product requirements.

## Key Files

The most important documents in this directory are:

*   `docs/01-Value-Proposition.md`: Explains the problem CartaOS aims to solve, the target audience, and the core value it provides.
*   `docs/02-Vision-Document.md`: Describes the long-term vision for the product, positioning it as the "operating system for academic research."
*   `docs/03-MVP-and-Requirements.md`: Defines the scope of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), which will be a desktop application focused on local document processing.
*   `docs/05-System-Architecture.md`: Provides a high-level overview of the system's architecture, including the frontend, backend, and data storage components.
*   `docs/07-Technology-Stack.md`: Details the specific technologies chosen for the project, including Flutter for the frontend, Go for the backend, and PostgreSQL with pgvector for the database.
*   `docs/ADR-001-Flutter-for-Frontend.md`: An Architecture Decision Record that justifies the choice of Flutter for the cross-platform client application.
